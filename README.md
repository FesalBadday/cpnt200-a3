**Information :**

- I had some troubles with styling my pages because I did forget to install Vuetify so I tried to add it after I did get everything to work but then I realized adding Vuetify was not as easy as I thought when initializing my project for the first time so all I did is I took the easy way and I just made a new project and made sure that I did install Vuetify.
